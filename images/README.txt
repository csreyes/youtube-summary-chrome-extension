Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the following icon files for the extension:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You should replace these with your own custom icons before publishing the extension.

For quick placeholder icons, you can use a simple colored square with "YT" or a play button with a summary symbol.
